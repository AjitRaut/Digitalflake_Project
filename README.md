## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the Digitalflake 2024 '8 hrs Job Hackathon.' The application was built using **React** for the frontend and **Node.js** for the backend. It demonstrates skills in full-stack development, focusing on user authentication, database interactions, and front-end user interfaces using a data grid for displaying records.

The goal is to develop an application that is scalable and maintainable, with clean commits and functional features that work across different devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Data Grid / React Table**: To display data in a grid/table format.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for responsive designs.
- **React Bootstrap**: Optional, for building responsive UIs.
- **Context API / Redux**: State management (either is acceptable).

### Backend
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side code.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js.
- **JWT (jsonwebtoken)**: For user authentication and token management.
- **bcrypt**: To securely hash user passwords.

### Database
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user and application data.

### Bonus
- **TypeScript**: Optional, for adding static type checking to the JavaScript codebase.

## Features
- User Authentication with JWT.
- Password encryption using bcrypt.
- Responsive UI with React and Tailwind CSS.
- Data displayed in a grid using React Data Grid or React Table.
- CRUD operations on the backend with MongoDB.
- Secure API with token-based authentication.
